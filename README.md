# D&DTrivia
Welcome to Dungeons & Dragons Trivia!

This program is made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
I made this trivia D&D themed because I am a big fan of the game and I've been playing for many years now.
The game was tested by my friends Lucas, Max, Zak, and Quinn. Though they thought it was too easy.
The questions should be difficult for someone who doesn't know much on the subject but still guessable with some knowledge.

How to Play:

1. Click one of the four multiple choice answers

2. Do so before you run out of time.

3. Continue until you finish!

When the game is over it will tell you how many you got correct, how many wrong, and how many you didn't answer. Then you can press the Start Over button to try again!

Enjoy!
